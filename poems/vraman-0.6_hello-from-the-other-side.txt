hello from the other side of 
disabled people a crucial element to starting a dialogue 
around 
and pursue hobbies and walking in circles 
to take offense every time they paid 
my nerves is euphemisms maintained better than most elevators 
and lifts elevators have shafts surrounding walls 
and my plight from elementary and middle school
