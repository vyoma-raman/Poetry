it was a dark and stormy night 
as i cannot be taken 
that they want to accept 
but i can do without unexpected weather fluctuations 
and going to the inherent prejudices 
that exist in our society 
for which i'm very grateful 
down to write tomorrow's to do list 
message hard to move toward a single
my brain for the one frontier 
that my spinal muscular atrophy 
or my past hospitalizations 
or living with my life 
and to my life to my life to my life
